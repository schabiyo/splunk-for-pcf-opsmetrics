## Splunk Add-on for PCF Ops Metrics

The Splunk Add-on for [PCF Ops Metrics](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-metrics) uses the *Splunk Add-on for Java Management Extensions (JMX)* to provide additional monitoring and alerting of PCF. You can download and configure this add-on the same way you would the Splunk developed one or you can copy and paste just the additional views into your existing add-on.

__NB__ The *Splunk Add-on for JMX* is intended to replace the add-on components of *Monitoring of Java Virtual Machines with JMX*. See migration guide [here](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/latest/JMX/Releasehistory) for details.

Many of the dashboards in this add-on were taken from Mark Seidenstricker's [splunk-pcf-monitor](https://github.com/mjseid/splunk-pcf-monitor) and updated to support the latest 1.6 version of PCF Ops Metrics.

Documentation for the Splunk JMX add-on is located [here](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/latest/JMX/About).
