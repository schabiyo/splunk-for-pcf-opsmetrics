## Splunk Add-on for PCF Ops Metrics

The Splunk Add-on for PCF Ops Metrics uses the Splunk Add-on for Java Management Extensions (JMX) to provide additional monitoring and alerting of PCF. You can download and configure this add-on the same way you would the Splunk developed one or you can copy and paste just the additional views into your existing add-on.

__NB__ The Splunk Add-on for JMX is intended to replace the add-on components of Monitoring of Java Virtual Machines with JMX.
